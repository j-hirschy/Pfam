# Pfam

In this notebook we will fine tune a GRU (http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078) based model to classify the protein domain given it's amino acid sequence.

The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/googleai/pfam-seed-random-split which was proposed by Bileschi et al. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/626507v2.full).

The data folder from kaggle should be extracted in the same directory as this notebook.
